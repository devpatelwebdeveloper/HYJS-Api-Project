# HY JS API Project :- Travel Story

[Story Finder | Exciting tours by adventurous people](https://devpatelwebdeveloper.github.io/HYJS-Api-Project/)

Search for Brampton, Frankfurt, Ahmedabad, 176 clyde road winnipeg. It will give you dummy story. When clicked on More About City, It will give the current temperature and Current Date and Time about the town you searched for. This project is still work in progress. You can search any city in the world. Storys will not be displaying currently as working on creating JSON for the story.

- Idea here is to search for the story wherevere I have travelled.
- Currently I have added some very less Stories for testing purpose and will convert it to json once I add more
- When you click on the story, currently it produces just the text copied from Wikipedia, and when clicked on read more, it gives the local time and temperature and other details.
- It also shows the pictures taken, related to that.
- You can try searching Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Mumbai, Frankfurt, Brampton, Winnipeg, Chicago.
- If the story is not available, it gives the dummy story not yet created but its in the plan.
